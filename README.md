### Description
This shows a web-based application titled "LSTM Predictor," designed to accept a numeric sequence input and return a predicted value using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Users are prompted to enter a comma-separated sequence of numbers (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), which the application processes to generate a prediction, displayed below the input box. The interface is clean and user-friendly, featuring a modern blue gradient background with a centered input form and a clear "Predict" button. The prediction result, such as "0.07710679," is displayed prominently, reflecting the output of the underlying LSTM model. The application is running locally on 127.0.0.1:8000, suggesting it is in the development or testing phase, likely built using Python for the backend (with frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI) and a simple HTML/CSS frontend. This tool is particularly useful for time series or sequence prediction tasks, and enhancements like input validation, model output explanation, or visual representation of the prediction could further improve usability.

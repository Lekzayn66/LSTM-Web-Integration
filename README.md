### Description
This is a simple web app that takes a comma-separated number sequence as input and predicts the next value. For example, when the user enters just "2" as input, the app processes it and displays a predicted result, which in this case is 0.22587028. It's likely built using a neural network model like LSTM and is useful for demonstrating how predictions work with numerical sequences.
